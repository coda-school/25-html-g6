            <b>CODA School arrives in Dijon: a new era for digital education in Burgundy</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            In a world where digital technology shapes the future, the CODA higher education school in computer science is establishing itself as a key player in tech training in France. Founded in 2022 by Marin Vogler and Léni Maroglou, two passionate young engineers, CODA continues its expansion with the opening of a brand-new campus in Dijon, at the heart of the City of Dukes.

          </br>
          <p class="title-paragraphe"><b>CODA: a school focused on innovation</b></p>
          <p>
            CODA offers training in computer development, including a <em>Bachelor in Full Stack Development</em> with the possibility of work-study, as well as master-level programs. The school stands out for its hands-on, collaborative, and market-adaptive teaching approach. Recognized by the State, it aims to train tomorrow’s digital talents in human-scale cities, with the ambition of opening ten campuses in ten years.

          <p>
            Officially inaugurated on October 9, 2025, the Dijon campus is located at <em>4 boulevard Docteur Jean Veillet</em>, in shared premises with ESADD (Higher School of Digital Art and Design) and CCI Formation. This strategic choice places CODA close to public transport, student housing, and the city’s economic hubs.

            For its inaugural semester, the Dijon campus welcomes <em>50 students</em>, supervised by professionals from the industry. The sponsor of this first class is none other than <em>Pierre-Henri Deballon</em>, a Dijon-based entrepreneur and co-founder of Weezevent, a symbol of local dynamism.

            Beyond classes, CODA fosters student life and peer exchange. Events, workshops, hackathons, and open house days (next dates: November 6 and December 8) punctuate campus life. The school values people as much as code, training professionals who can collaborate, communicate, and innovate.

      <p>
        This week, the Côte-d’Or Department hosted the Artificial Intelligence Seminar of the Departments of France, bringing together around thirty local authorities from the DATA Departments club. Objective: share local innovations in digital sovereignty and artificial intelligence for public service.
      </p>
      </br>
      <p class="title-paragraphe"><b>A pioneering department in digital sovereignty</b></p>
      <p>
        A forerunner in using AI for public management, the Department led by François Sauvadet presented several concrete projects already deployed in the region.
        <em>“AI is a powerful tool for steering our public policies and managing our infrastructure. We must get on board if we want to preserve our sovereignty and avoid being overwhelmed tomorrow,”</em> emphasized the president of the Departmental Council.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over two days, elected officials, experts, and technicians discussed the challenges of modernizing and transforming public action through emerging technologies. The department, alongside Stephen Loureiro, head of digital transformation, showcased several practical use cases: smart debt management, digital twins for building energy management, and predictive planning tools.

      <p class="title-paragraphe"><b>Facing cyber threats: a local and sovereign response</b></p>
      <p>
        The issue of public data security was central to the discussions. Highlighting a 60% increase in cyberattacks in 2024 (according to ANSSI), François Sauvadet advocated a
        <em>“local and sovereign”</em> approach:
        <em>“Municipalities often lack the means and expertise to face cyber threats. We offer them a turnkey, local, and reliable solution.”</em>
      </p>
      <p>To anticipate these risks, Côte-d’Or has implemented a complete and independent infrastructure:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A modern and secure departmental datacenter,</li>
        <li>A local cloud hosted in Côte-d’Or,</li>
        <li>Solutions adapted even for the smallest rural municipalities.</li>
      </ul>
      </br>
      <p class="title-paragraphe"><b>cloud.cotedor.fr: a digital public service for municipalities</b></p>
      <p>
        Launched in July 2025, the cloud.cotedor.fr service is already a success: 100 municipalities have joined to secure their data and administrative exchanges.<br />
        This departmental offer includes three integrated services:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Official email @communes.cotedor.fr, locally hosted and secure.</li>
        <li>Sovereign storage, a true digital safe for archiving and syncing sensitive documents.</li>
        <li>Detoxio cybersecurity device, which automatically blocks intrusions and cyberattacks.</li>
      </ul>
      </br>
      <p class="title-paragraphe"><b>Fast and measurable results</b></p>
      <p>
        Early feedback is encouraging: in municipalities equipped with the Detoxio device, nearly 1,000 malicious flows were blocked in one month. These attacks, mainly from the United States, China, and Russia, aimed to steal sensitive data or paralyze public services.
        <em>“These figures show how exposed municipalities are. With cloud.cotedor.fr, we give them concrete, simple, and sovereign tools to protect themselves without relying on foreign giants,”</em> insists François Sauvadet.
      </p>
      </br>
      <p class="title-paragraphe"><b>Personalized support for municipalities</b></p>
      <p>Municipalities can now:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Get their @communes.cotedor.fr email address,</li>
        <li>Migrate their documents to the secure cloud,</li>
        <li>Install the Detoxio device to protect their network.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The Department offers tailored technical support to ease the transition and data recovery.<br />
        Interested local authorities can contact the service at:
        <a class="a" href="mailto:services.cloud@cotedor.fr">services.cloud@cotedor.fr</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        With this seminar, Côte-d’Or confirms its role as a national laboratory for public innovation and digital sovereignty. An approach that could inspire many other regions seeking to combine performance, security, and technological independence.

      </br>
      <p class="title-paragraphe"><b>A fast-growing regional dynamic</b></p>
      <p>
        These days mark a new milestone in the regional digital transformation strategy. The goal is clear:
        <em>facilitate medical practices, improve care coordination, and strengthen health data security.</em>
        Workshops, conferences, and roundtables cover various topics: cybersecurity, telemedicine, system interoperability, and support for professionals in using digital tools.

        Mathilde Marmier, Director General of ARS, and Cyrille Politi, Regional Delegate of FHF Bourgogne-Franche-Comté, emphasized the importance of
        <em>mobilizing all local stakeholders</em> to build more connected, efficient, and humane healthcare. The event reflects a strong desire to make Bourgogne-Franche-Comté a
