            <p>
              In a world shaped by digital technology, CODA, a higher education
              school in computer science, is becoming a key player in tech
              training in France. Founded in 2022 by Marin Vogler and Léni
              Maroglou, two passionate young engineers, CODA continues its
              expansion with the opening of a brand-new campus in Dijon, at the
              heart of the City of Dukes.
            </p>

            <h3><strong>CODA: a school focused on innovation</strong></h3>
            <p>
              CODA offers training in software development, including a
              <em>Bachelor in Full Stack Development</em> with the option of
              work-study, as well as master's-level programs. The school stands
              out for its hands-on, collaborative, and market-driven teaching
              approach. Recognized by the State, it aims to train tomorrow’s
              digital talents in human-scale cities, with the ambition of
              opening ten campuses in ten years.

            </h3>
            <p>
              Officially inaugurated on October 9, 2025, the Dijon campus is
              located at <em>4 boulevard Docteur Jean Veillet</em>, in shared
              premises with ESADD (Higher School of Digital Art and Design) and
              CCI Formation. This strategic location places CODA close to public
              transport, student housing, and the city’s economic hubs.
            </p>

            <h3><strong>A promising first class</strong></h3>
            <p>
              For its inaugural semester, the Dijon campus welcomes
              <em>50 students</em>, supervised by professionals from the tech
              industry. The sponsor of this first class is none other than
              <em>Pierre-Henri Deballon</em>, a Dijon-based entrepreneur and
              co-founder of Weezevent, a symbol of local dynamism.

              Beyond classes, CODA encourages student life and peer exchange.
              Events, workshops, hackathons, and open days (next dates: November
              6 and December 8) bring the campus to life. The school values
              people as much as code, training professionals who can
              collaborate, communicate, and innovate.

            <h3><strong>Clear ambitions for the future</strong></h3>
            <p>
              With its establishment in Dijon, CODA confirms its commitment to
              making digital education accessible in dynamic regions often
              underrepresented in the tech sector. The school doesn’t just teach
              technical skills: it prepares students to become change-makers,
              capable of meeting digital challenges in diverse environments. By
              focusing on excellence, proximity, and innovation, CODA charts an
              ambitious path for tomorrow’s talents in Burgundy and beyond. This
              territorial development model fosters the emergence of local
              ecosystems where students can thrive without leaving their region.
              CODA Dijon thus becomes a catalyst for skills, projects, and
              opportunities for the entire digital community in Burgundy.

              This week, the Côte-d'Or Department hosted the Artificial
              Intelligence Seminar of the Departments of France, bringing
              together around thirty local authorities from the DATA Departments
              club. Objective: to share local innovations in digital sovereignty
              and artificial intelligence for public service.

            <h3>
              <strong>A pioneering department in digital sovereignty</strong>
            </h3>
            <p>
              A forerunner in the use of AI for public management, the
              Department led by François Sauvadet presented several concrete
              projects already deployed in the region.
              <em
                >“AI is a powerful lever for steering our public policies and
                managing our infrastructure. We must get on board if we want to
                preserve our sovereignty and avoid being overwhelmed
                tomorrow,”</em
              >
              emphasized the President of the Departmental Council.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over two days, elected officials, experts, and technicians
              discussed the challenges of modernizing and transforming public
              action through emerging technologies. The department, alongside
              Stephen Loureiro, Head of Digital Transformation, presented
              several practical use cases: smart debt management, digital twins
              for building energy management, and predictive planning tools.

            </h3>
            <p>
              The issue of public data security was at the heart of the
              discussions. Recalling the 60% increase in cyberattacks in 2024
              (according to ANSSI), François Sauvadet advocated for a
              <em>“local and sovereign”</em> approach:
              <em
                >“Municipalities often lack the means and skills to face cyber
                threats. We provide them with a turnkey, local, and reliable
                solution.”</em
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              To anticipate these risks, Côte-d'Or has built a complete and
              independent infrastructure:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>A modern and secure departmental data center,</li>
              <li>A local cloud hosted in Côte-d'Or,</li>
              <li>
                And solutions adapted even to the smallest rural town halls.
              </li>
            </ul>

              >
            </h3>
            <p>
              Launched in July 2025, the cloud.cotedor.fr service is already a
              success: 100 municipalities have joined to secure their data and
              administrative exchanges.<br />
              This departmental offer includes three integrated services:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Official email @communes.cotedor.fr, hosted locally and secured.
              </li>
              <li>
                Sovereign storage, a true digital safe for archiving and syncing
                sensitive documents.
              </li>
              <li>
                Detoxio cybersecurity box, which automatically blocks intrusions
                and cyberattacks.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section class="block">
            <h3><strong>Fast and measurable results</strong></h3>
            <p>
              Initial feedback is already encouraging: in municipalities
              equipped with the Detoxio box, nearly 1,000 malicious flows were
              blocked in one month. These attacks, mainly from the United
              States, China, and Russia, aimed to steal sensitive data or
              paralyze public services.
              <em
                >“These figures show how exposed town halls are. With
                cloud.cotedor.fr, we give them concrete, simple, and sovereign
                tools to protect themselves without relying on foreign
                giants,”</em
              >
              insists François Sauvadet.
            </p>

            <h3><strong>Personalized support for municipalities</strong></h3>
            <p>Municipalities can now:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Get their @communes.cotedor.fr email address,</li>
              <li>Migrate their documents to the secure cloud,</li>
              <li>And install the Detoxio box to protect their network.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The Department offers tailored technical support to ease the
              transition and data recovery.<br />
              Interested local authorities can contact the service at:
              <a class="a" href="mailto:services.cloud@cotedor.fr"

            </p>
            <p>
              With this seminar, Côte-d'Or confirms its role as a national
              laboratory for public innovation and digital sovereignty. An
              approach that could inspire many other regions seeking to combine
              performance, security, and technological independence.
